# Session 3


## Required Self-Study

- [Using AI within Pipelines via `ellmer`](../episodes/ai-pipelines-ellmer.md)
- [Revise Your Code with AI](../episodes/revise-code-with-ai.md)



## Session Plan


### AI-usage via ellmer

- ? `ellmer` installed and working? chat-check, see material !
- ? What is a major problem, when using `ellmer` via map?
  - Advantages of "aggregated calls" and "structured output"


- GROUP: 
  * ! identify at least 4 reasonable use cases for AI-calls via `ellmer`!
  * ? what kind of tasks are not suited for AI-calls or can be done otherwise?
  * ? what are drawbacks/cons of AI-usage in data processing?

- ? Thoughts about reproducability and reliability?
- ? How to guide the reliability of an LLM?
  - discussion of 
    - [*temperature* parameter](https://www.vellum.ai/llm-parameters/temperature)
    - *top p* = top tokens with cumulative probability up to *p* (lower = more restrictive)
    - *top k* = *k* highest tokens (lower = more restrictive) (not always supported)
  
- ? and energy consumption?!?

- ? AI vs. human in data processing... whom to trust? when and why?

- Best practice discussion/summary
