# Session 1


## Required Self-Study

- Summary and Setup
- [Getting Started with GitHub Copilot](../episodes/getting-started-with-copilot.md)
- [Where Do We Need AI Support?](../episodes/where-ai-support.html)



## Session Plan

### Intro of participants

- Who am I?
- **Who are you?**
  - fields of studies?
  - Background in programming?
    - R, Python, other languages?
    - AI for coding tasks?
    - git(hub)?
    
### Intro to course
    
- **Goals of the course**
  - experiencing different use cases for AI in R(Studio) coding
  - discussion and consideration of AI-coding-related issues and implications
  - awareness of possibilities and limits
- **Course setup**
  - style and workflow (inversed/flipped classroom)
  - what is expected from you?
  - what do you expect from me?
- **Technicalities**
  - GitHub account & student status registration
    - all set up? problems?
  - What is GitHub (for)?
  - Why GitHub Copilot in this course?
  
### Experiences with AI-supported coding

As a follow-up to the task in "Where Do We Need AI Support?" 

(*Students should have thought about and made some notes...!*)

- **Discussion of AI coding experiences**
  - Have you used AI coding assistants before? What was your experience?
  - Can you share an example where AI helped you solve a problem?
  - Can you share an example where AI suggestions were incorrect or unhelpful?
  - How do you decide when to use AI assistance versus figuring things out yourself?

### AI for self-study

- AI-bots for self-assessment = example for tailored AI-supported learning
- ? experiences? useful? annoying? alternatives? hacks?


### Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

- **TASK**: Write a short description of your field of interest and what data sets are typically used in your field. 
  Use GitHub Copilot to help you write this description.
  - Start with creating a new Markdown file
  - Set a descriptive header prefixed with an `#` to mark it as a title (e.g., `# My Field of Interest`)
  - Write a few sentences describing your field and the data sets you work with.
  - Use GitHub Copilot to generate suggestions for your description. 
    You can trigger suggestions by typing and accepting them with `Tab` or `Enter`.
    You can also ask Copilot specific questions or for help with phrasing by typing prompts like "Write a sentence about..." or "What are common data sets in...?"
  - What suggestions does Copilot give you?
  - How do you evaluate the quality of these suggestions?
  - Do you find the suggestions helpful? Why or why not?

### Discussion of secrets and sensitive information

- [Passwords and Tokens via System Variables](private-tokens.md)
  - Why is it important to keep secrets out of your code?
  - How can you manage secrets securely in RStudio?
  - What are the best practices for using environment variables to store sensitive information?
